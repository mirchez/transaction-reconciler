# Fix Instructions for "Transaction not found" Error

## The Problem
The error occurs because:
1. The Prisma schema has been updated to remove `userId` fields
2. But the Prisma client (TypeScript types) still expects `userId`
3. This causes database operations to fail

## Quick Fix Steps

### Option 1: Regenerate Prisma Client (Recommended)
Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Generate new Prisma client without userId
pnpm prisma generate

# 2. Apply migration to remove userId from database
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name remove_user_id
```

### Option 2: Reset Everything (If you don't have important data)
```bash
# This will drop and recreate the database
pnpm prisma migrate reset
```

### Option 3: Manual Database Fix
If the above doesn't work, you can manually fix the database:

1. Connect to your database
2. Run these SQL commands:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "LedgerEntry" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "userId";
ALTER TABLE "BankTransaction" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "userId";
ALTER TABLE "MatchLog" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "userId";
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Visit `/api/debug` in your browser to check database status
2. Try uploading a CSV file with test data
3. Check if transactions appear in the results page

## If Still Having Issues

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Check the terminal/server logs for Prisma errors
3. The error message will tell you exactly what's wrong (e.g., "userId is required")

## Test Data
You can create test data by making a POST request to `/api/test-data`
